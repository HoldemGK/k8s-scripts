# RX-M - SSH setup for Cloud Lab Access

RX-M courses can be delivered in conjunction with a cloud based lab environment. To access a cloud lab 
system during class students will need to have an ssh client installed on their computer and internet
ssh access. 

Any mainstream ssh client will work and OSX/Linux computer systems have a good ssh client preinstalled. 

Here are some suggested ssh client tools for Windows systems:

- Putty (free) [Windows] https://www.putty.org/
- MobaXTerm (free and paid) [Windows] https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html
