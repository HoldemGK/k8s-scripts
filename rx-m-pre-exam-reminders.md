# Pre-Exam Reminders for CKA, CKAD, CKS Exams

## Testing Location Rules

The online proctor will require a webcam and audio feed and ask you to provide a 360 degree view of the room to ensure compliance with the rules in the handbook. While your microphone does need to be active, we recommend you turn off your speakers since the proctor will only communicate with you via chat and it will limit possible feedback during your exam.

Some notable ones about the location are below:
- No one other than the candidate can be present in the room
   - Note: In light of the current global situation with shelter-in-place restrictions, the proctor has increased flexibility with common sense rules if someone does mistakenly enter the room.
- Testing from public spaces such as coffee shops, stores, etc. is not allowed
- Room must be quiet, private and well lit
- Bright lights or windows should not be positioned behind the Candidate
- No electronic device in your ears, on your face or on your body unless medically necessary
- No food or drinks except clear liquids in a clear container
- Desk must be clear of all notes and electronics
   - Make sure you have your government-issued photo ID to show the online proctor.


## Preparing your Machine

Make sure you complete all the steps in the "Exam Preparation Checklist" by logging in with your LFID information at <https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/>. Find your "In Progress" Certification items and click "Resume" to review the list.
  - If you need to go back, the direct link to the "Check System Requirements" is here: https://www.examslocal.com/ScheduleExam/Home/CompatibilityCheck.
    - Option 3 allows you to select the Sponsor "Linux Foundation" and the exam.
  - Chrome or Chromium are currently the only browsers that work for the exam. Please make sure you install the Chrome extension from the Compatibility Check or you will not be able to launch the exam.

During the exam, Candidate may only run one application - the Chrome/Chromium browser in which the exam is shown. The proctor will request that you shut down all other applications. Other than the exam tab, you can use 1 other tab to access:
  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/ and its subdomains (translated pages OK as well)
  - https://kubernetes.io/blog/
  - https://github.com/kubernetes/ and its subdomains


## Launching the Exam

When it's time for the exam, you can go to: https://www.examslocal.com/linuxfoundation to log in with your Linux Foundation ID (LFID) account. Once logged in, click on My Exams and select the exam from the left margin to get started. You can begin the check-in process when you see a green "Launch Exam" button next to a timer. This may appear up to 15 minutes before your official exam time.

If the Launch Button does not show up within 5 minutes of the scheduled start time, click on "Online- Click here to get help" to open the support chat.

NOTE: Getting marked as a "no-show" means you **will not** be able to use your free retake.


## Timing for the Exam

The proctor keeps the ultimate timer for the exam. The exam time **does not start** until the Proctor finishes checking if you are in compliance with the rules and releases the exam.

Note that you can use the "Pause Exam" option on the menu to request a break from the proctor but they don't stop the timer for the exam.

If you are facing technical difficulties, please inform your proctor promptly. If difficulties persist for an extended period of time, they will likely take this into consideration for your exam period but you can always ask the proctor how much time is left if you are uncertain.


## Results and Rescoring

You will generally see results within 36 hours from the time that the exam was completed. If you do not get an email from the Linux Foundation, you can also check on your account by logging in at https://training.cncf.io/portal. If you need free retake, it will auto populate in your account for scheduling.

Note: There is an option to rescore your exam but we generally do not recommend it because:
   - Rescores rarely result in a change of score because exams are graded on outcomes (not the path students take to get there)
   - Candidates must request a rescore within 2 days following the date of exam
   - There is a fee (though it may be refunded if the rescore results in a pass)
